// Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties 
// for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
// On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:
// Soup
// Serves: 2
// Ingredients: cinnamon, cumin, cocoa



Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.
